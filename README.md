README - Book App

Overview

This project is a Book App built using modern web technologies. The application allows users to browse, search, and manage books dynamically.

Implementation Details

To build this app, we used JavaScript, and Vercel for deployment. Below is a brief explanation of how different functionalities were implemented:

1. Data Fetching

Used Fetch API / Axios to get book data from an API or a local JSON file.

Implemented async/await for handling asynchronous requests.

2. State Management

Used Js useState() to manage local states like book lists, search results, and selected books.

Used useEffect() for handling side effects like fetching data on component mount.

3. Routing & Navigation

Implemented Js Router for navigation between different pages like Home, Book Details, etc.

4. Search Functionality

Implemented a search bar using an onChange event handler.

Used filter() function to dynamically display search results as the user types.

5. Responsive UI

Used CSS3 & TailwindCSS for styling and responsive layout.

Applied CSS Flexbox & Grid for a clean design.

6. Book Details & Dynamic Routing

Used React Router's useParams() to fetch and display specific book details.
